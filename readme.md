## Objective: 
The goal was to build a simple rendering engine using Go, capable of fetching and displaying web content without processing JavaScript or CSS. The focus was on handling HTML and images, and displaying them in a basic GUI.

## Development Steps:
- Language Selection: Chose Go (Golang) for its simplicity and efficiency, especially in handling networking and concurrency.

## Initial Setup:
- Created basic scaffolding for fetching and parsing HTML content.
- Discussed the installation of Go and setting up a Go environment.

## HTML Parsing and Fetching:
- Implemented functions to fetch HTML content from URLs and parse it using goquery.
- Designed to extract text and image URLs from HTML.

## Building a GUI:
- Decided to use the fyne package for GUI development.
- Created a function to display both text and image content in a simple window.

## Project Structure and Testing:
- Discussed structuring the project into multiple files (main.go, htmlparser.go, renderer.go, and test files).
- Provided guidance on writing tests in Go using the built-in testing framework.

## Handling Images:
- Developed a method to fetch and display images from URLs in the GUI.

## GitHub and Licensing:
- Advised on choosing an open-source license for the GitHub repository.
- Guided through the process of pushing local code to a new GitHub repository.

## Key Technical Concepts Covered:
- Parsing HTML content.
- Basic GUI creation and handling in Go.
- Network requests for fetching web resources.
- Structuring a Go project and writing tests.
- Basic Git commands for version control and GitHub usage.

## Future Considerations:
- Possible expansion to handle more HTML elements.
- Improving the GUI for a more refined user experience.
- Considering asynchronous loading and caching for images.
- Ensuring security and robust error handling, especially for external resources.
- The session was focused on practical steps and hands-on coding, providing a foundation for building a basic web content rendering engine in Go.
